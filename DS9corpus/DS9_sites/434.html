O'BRIEN: Open a new file, computer. O'Brien, personal log, stardate

got to try to set the record straight about the last fifty two hours. I
don't know who's going to hear this. I don't even know if I'll be alive
by the time this log is recovered. I figure they'll be coming after me.
If I'm right about this whole thing, they won't want me to warn the
Paradas. Coffee, Jamaican blend, double strong, double sweet. I wish I
could tell you who they are. That's part of the puzzle I haven't
figured out yet. Part of the puzzle, hell. None of this whole damn
thing makes any sense. I'm trying to remember the first time I noticed
that things were wrong. It seems to me it was, yeah.

KEIKO: What did they have you doing? <br>
O'BRIEN: The Paradas? They put me through basic training on all the
security measures they want in place for the peace talks. Odo would
have had a field day. I wish he could have been there. <br>

O'BRIEN: DeCurtis, I appreciate your bushy-tailed enthusiasm but I was
waiting for Odo to came back from Bajor to do this. We have to realign
the entire security net for the peace talks. The Constable might have a

O'BRIEN: Excuses? <br>

were a little upset. <br>
O'BRIEN: Not upset, exactly. <br>
SISKO: No, no, you had every right to be. I'm sorry I assigned him
before advising you. I guess I dropped the ball on that one. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I guess I just felt a little left out of the loop, you
know. <br>
SISKO: Understood. I've gone through your reports on the Paradas. They
seem unusually preoccupied with security. <br>
O'BRIEN: They may be a little paranoid, but I suppose we would be too
if we'd been engaged in a civil war for twelve years. <br>
SISKO: Anything else I should know about them? Any unusual protocols we
should observe when they get here? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, nothing too out of the ordinary. It's all pretty much in
my report. <br>
SISKO: Now, tell me something that's not in the report. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir? <br>
SISKO: You know, the kind of things we don't include in reports but
might help me in these talks. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I'd have to give it some thought. There was one thing I
noticed. I don't know if it means anything or not, but the Paradas have
an odour from some kind of skin excretions, I'd guess. It changes with
their moods. When they're upset, it can get pretty strong actually. <br>
SISKO: I'll try not to get them upset. <br>
O'BRIEN: Good idea. <br>
SISKO: Their leaders have been in regular contact with us. I've assured
them that we'll be following all of their security recommendations to
the letter. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll see to that. <br>
SISKO: Well, I certainly want you to check everything before they get
here, but the upfront work can be done by the Engineering crews. I have
bigger problems for you. <br>
O'BRIEN: Bigger? <br>
SISKO: All three upper pylons are down again. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's impossible. I went over that repair work when I got
back. The pressure locks seemed to be at maximum efficiency. <br>
SISKO: You'd better check again. We had to tow a Bolian freighter to a
lower dock this morning. <br>
O'BRIEN: It can't be anything that serious. I rebuilt that entire
subsystem myself. I'll get on it right away. <br>
SISKO: After your physical. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. Oh, by the way, I noticed you and Keiko out in front
of the school this morning, talking. Is there anything wrong? <br>
SISKO: Oh, Jake is having some problems with his grades. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Keiko's very fond of the boy. I'm
sure she'll work that much harder to help him. <br>

something wrong with me, I'll see if I can't grow you a hangnail. <br>

last spring? Me blathering on about this woman I've never met before? <br>
BASHIR: Of course. Now I remember. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are you finished? <br>
BASHIR: Not quite. I just have one or two more tests to run. <br>
O'BRIEN: This is insane! I haven't had a physical take this long since
I was born. Look, unless I'm dying or something, I think it's about
time. (pause) Wait. That's it, is it? I mean, there is something wrong
with me. That's why everyone seems so strange. <br>

fine, so it had to be an entirely new problem. I realised it wasn't
going to be a quick matter to track it down after all. And I couldn't

Sisko about secured messages from the Parada system but no indication
what those messages were about. Maybe they were afraid I'd get into
their files even with the security lockout. Smart people.

point. <br>
ODO: Do any of them know you're suspicious? <br>
O'BRIEN: Probably. I've asked a few questions, been a few places that
might have tipped them off. They'll be keeping close tabs on me. I'd
call Starfleet but what could I tell them? My wife doesn't seem like my
wife? Sisko's been making security arrangements without consulting me? <br>
ODO: They might even call Commander Sisko and start asking questions
about you. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's what I was afraid of. <br>
ODO: When are the Paradas due? <br>
O'BRIEN: Thirty eight hours. <br>
ODO: I don't want them coming anywhere near this place until we get
this cleared up. <br>
O'BRIEN: Agreed. <br>
ODO: Go on about your business. Don't do anything to get their
attention. In the meantime, I'll do some investigating. If I can
confirm your suspicions, we can go to Starfleet and the Bajoran
authorities at the same time. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm glad you're back, Odo. <br>

QUARK: Fine, we'll change the subject. So, tell me about the Paradas.
They're going to be here, when, tomorrow? <br>

O'BRIEN: Don't ask me to explain the politics of the situation, but I
know they've been fighting the government forces for twelve years. Why?
<br>
ODO: I'm just trying to understand the players involved here. <br>
O'BRIEN: Odo, Sisko's logs indicate that secret messages have been
coming from the Parada System. Could those messages have been from the
rebels? <br>
ODO: As a matter of fact, they were. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's already a breach of the security agreement we made with
the Paradan government, and it's a good enough reason for us to cancel
these peace talks. <br>
ODO: That still might be premature. <br>
O'BRIEN: What are you talking about? We've got more than enough (pause)
They got to you. <br>

learned how to do remarkable things with replicants. <br>

exam with flying colours, and he sure knew his way around the station. <br>
O'BRIEN: I had more wires attached to my head than you can count. Now I
know why. <br>
KIRA: We were trying to shut him out of every sensitive security area
while they were searching for you. He must have wondered what the hell
was going on with all of us. <br>
BASHIR: By the time we learned of your rescue, he'd already gotten away
from us and was on his way here. <br>
COUTU: I wonder why he was coming back? <br>
O'BRIEN: If it were me, I'd be trying to warn somebody there was
something wrong at the station. <br>
