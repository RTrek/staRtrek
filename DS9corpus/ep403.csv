"Commander's office","ODO: Will that be all, Commander?",403
"Commander's office","SISKO: I want you to know I don't personally believe that you were responsible for this.",403
"Commander's office","ODO: Really? Now how can that be true? You don't know me. You have no reason to believe that I wouldn't kill Ibudan if it suited my fancy. So don't tell me there isn't some doubt inside of you, some question about whether or not I murdered the man.",403
"Commander's office","SISKO: I simply feel that putting Kira and Dax in charge of the investigation will be in everyone's best interests, including your own.",403

"Security office","QUARK: Well now, there's a piece of good news to brighten my day.",403
"Security office","ODO: You'd better take advantage of my absence while you can, Quark.",403
"Security office","QUARK: Oh, I will, I will. Count on it. I'll have every confidence man in the sector on board by tomorrow.",403
"Security office","ODO: You do and I'll",403
"Security office","QUARK: What?",403
"Security office","ODO: You're going get sloppy without me to keep an eye on you",403

"Security office","ODO: Quark, think you could use a shape-shifter in your organisation?",403
"Security office","QUARK: You had me going.",403
"Security office","ODO: I did, didn't I.",403
"Security office","QUARK: Yes, you did. You know, I've been asking some friends at Kran-Tobol prison about Ibudan. Whether he made any enemies while he was there. Couldn't find any. Mostly he stayed around the Bajoran dissidents that the Cardassians locked up. ",403
"Infirmary","BASHIR: It's growing exponentially. We're going to have to increase the metabolic field energy.",403
"Infirmary","SISKO: Just what is it that's growing in there?",403
"Infirmary","DAX: Aren't those DNA patterns humanoid, Julian?",403
"Infirmary","BASHIR: That's what it looks like to me, but there's a genetic drift I can't quite put my finger on.",403
"Infirmary","SISKO: What was Ibudan up to?",403
"Infirmary","BASHIR: We're going to have to wait and see what this becomes before we have a clue. You can transfer it to the larger field now.",403

"Quark's","SISKO: I don't even know. He'll go, she'll go through a list of them, then out comes another one in a later conversation. I'd guess that Jadzia is probably the sixth host.",403
"Quark's","BASHIR: Has she changed much?",403
"Quark's","SISKO: Changed?",403
"Quark's","BASHIR: From the last one, Curzon Dax. I understand a Trill integrates the personality of each new host.",403
"Quark's","SISKO: I guess I'll have to find that out. If I were to tell you some of the mischief he and I got into. There was a time, I was no older than you are, we were at the running of the Rujian Steeplechase. Dax loves the races. Anyway, there were these gorgeous seven foot Ruji twin sisters that Curzon knew, and he and I. I guess we won't be doing that again soon, will we?",403
"Quark's","BASHIR: You care for her a great deal, don't you?",403
"Quark's","SISKO: Dax and I are just friends, Doctor. If you're interested, you have nothing to fear from me.",403
"Quark's","BASHIR: I mean, I were in your shoes, knowing Dax as intimately as you do, I think I'd find her hard to resist.",403
"Quark's","SISKO: You don't understand, Doctor. Dax used to beat me regularly at bare fist Juro counterpunch.",403

"Infirmary","SISKO: How can we be sure the victim was a clone?",403
"Infirmary","DAX: A clone has identical DNA to that of the donor, but certain cloning methods cause a characteristic gene-sequence degradation which can be detected.",403
