"Bridge","WORF: It is the Borg prisoner, and Commander Data.",252
"Bridge","(a flash on the viewscreen)",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Mister La Forge, can we follow them into the conduit?",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: We've got a pretty good reading of the tachyon pulse they sent. We might be able to duplicate it.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: The question is, is Data a prisoner or did he go willingly?",252
"Bridge","WORF: The command overrides used to disable the tractor were Commander Data's.",252
"Bridge","RIKER: The Borg could have downloaded the codes from Data's positronic net.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Perhaps Data's recent flash of emotion has something to do with this. It could have affected him more profoundly than we realise. Either way, we have to find him.",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: I've set up a temporary tachyon matrix in the main deflector. I think I can use it to simulate the pulse sent by the shuttle.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Mister Worf, red alert.",252
"Bridge","RIKER: All hands, battle stations.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Bring us to the last known coordinates of the shuttlecraft.",252
"Bridge","WORF: Shields up. Weapons ready.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Mister La Forge?",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: Energising the matrix. Emitting tachyons in the lower bandwidth.",252
"Bridge","WORF: Sensors show no unusual subspace activity.",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: All right. Switching to the secondary bandwidth. Nothing. Maybe if I try alternating the frequencies.",252
"Bridge","WORF: Captain, there is an energy fluctuation directly ahead of us. It is the subspace distortion.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Take us in, Ensign. One half impulse.",252
"Bridge","(in they go, shake rattle and roll) WORF: Power levels are down to sixty seven percent.",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: Compensating with auxiliary power.",252
"Bridge","(all calm again)",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Report.",252
"Bridge","RIKER: Navigational sensors show that we've travelled sixty five light years from our previous position.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Can you locate the shuttle?",252
"Bridge","WORF: No, sir. There is no indication of the shuttle within range of our sensors.",252
"Bridge","RIKER: Maybe we can find an energy signature from their engines.",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: Captain.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge.",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: I've scanned three different star systems within sensor range. There is evidence of at least two advanced civilisations but I'm reading no life signs. But there are indications that plasma weapons have been fired in those systems recently.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: The Borg have been busy.",252
"Bridge","RIKER: I think we've found the shuttle's energy signature.",252
"Bridge","WORF: They were heading two four seven, mark zero five nine.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Lay in that course, Ensign, and engage at full impulse.",252
"Bridge","ENSIGN: Aye, sir.",252
"Bridge","(in orbit of a mottled planet)",252
"Bridge","RIKER: We've traced the shuttle's energy signature to this point on the surface but there's too much interference to scan the location.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Are they intentionally jamming our sensors?",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: It looks more like a natural phenomenon. There's an unusually high amount of EM interference in the planet's magnetosphere.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Can we transport through the interference?",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: We could, but there could be fifty Borg down there waiting for us and we'd never even know it. RIKER: I think we have to take the risk.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Agreed. Take a well-armed away team and transport down to those coordinates. Have the transporter Chief keep a permanent lock on your signals so we can get you out of there at the first sign of trouble.",252
"Bridge","RIKER: Aye, sir. Mister Worf, you're with me. ",252
"Planet surface","(near the shuttlecraft El-Baz, in a very gold-brown tint)",252
"Planet surface","RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. We're on the surface. There's no sign of any Borg, or Data. The shuttle appears to be abandoned.",252
"Planet surface","WORF: The EM interference is limiting the tricorder range. It is useless beyond one hundred metres.",252
"Planet surface","RIKER: There are ",252
"Bridge","RIKER [OC]: No structures in the area. They could've gone anywhere.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Can you determine how long they've been gone from the shuttlecraft? ",252
"Planet surface","RIKER: The engine's been off a little over three hours. ",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Stand by, Number One. Assuming that they're still together, how far could they have travelled in three hours?",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: Well, Data can move pretty fast even over rough terrain, but based on what we know about the Borg, I don't think they should be able to move any faster than you or I. They might have been able to get fifteen or twenty kilometres from the shuttle by now.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Picard to Riker.",252
"Bridge","RIKER [OC]: Riker here.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: I'm going to start sending down other away teams. Set up a command post and begin mapping out a search plan.",252
"Bridge","RIKER [OC]: Understood, sir.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Picard out. I want to use the shuttlecraft for low level reconnaissance. Have the designated pilots assemble at main shuttlebay.",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: Aye, sir.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: And all available personnel, including you and me, will begin to put together four man away teams. We'll leave a skeleton crew on board the ship.",252
"Bridge","LAFORGE: Who'll be in command of the Enterprise?",252
"Bridge","(later)",252
"Bridge","CRUSHER: Any last orders?",252
"Bridge","PICARD: If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else to return to the ship but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space.",252
"Bridge","CRUSHER: Got it. Good luck, Jean-Luc.",252
"Bridge","PICARD: Good luck, Captain. ",252
"Planet surface","RIKER: I've sent out twelve teams so far. I've got your team searching section gamma two four. Worf and I will take theta one six when the last team comes down.",252
"Planet surface","PICARD: Who's manning the command post?",252
"Planet surface","RIKER: Wallace and Towles. Ready?",252
"Planet surface","(Picard, Troi, La Forge and a guard with a phaser rifle head off)",252
"Planet surface","(they stop just below the crest of a valley)",252
"Planet surface","PICARD: Anything, Mister La Forge?",252
"Planet surface","LAFORGE: Well, no. Nothing, sir.",252
"Planet surface","PICARD: What if we modified the phasers to send out a luvetric pulse? It might create a resonance fluctuation in Data's power cells.",252
"Planet surface","LAFORGE: Home in on that response with our tricorders. Yeah, I thought about that. The only problem is that the pulse would probably have to be so powerful that it would destroy Data's positronic net in the process.",252
"Planet surface","(Troi is looking over the crest)",252
"Planet surface","TROI: Captain. I think I've found something.",252
"Planet surface","(it's a curved building)",252
"Planet surface","PICARD: Come on. ",252
"outside the building","LAFORGE: I'm having trouble scanning the interior.",252
"outside the building","PICARD: Can you tell if it was built by the Borg?",252
"outside the building","LAFORGE: I don't think so. There are no Borg energy signatures. But there is a door or a hatch or something about twenty metres this way. ",252
"Borg hall","(decorated with what is presumably the Borg symbol and a raised dais/podium at the far end)",252
"Borg hall","TROI: This seems to be some kind of meeting place.",252
"Borg hall","PICARD: Well, it certainly hasn't been abandoned.",252
"Borg hall","LAFORGE: Something's wrong. I can't get any kind of energy signatures from these light sources.",252
"Borg hall","PICARD: It's a dampening field. This entire structure could be shielded from our sensors. Let's go.",252
"Borg hall","(the Borg enter)",252
"Borg hall","BORG: There they are! Block the exit.",252
"Borg hall","(vastly outnumbered by openly hostile Borg, the security man tries for a shot and gets killed)",252
"Borg hall","LORE: Stop!",252
"Borg hall","PICARD: Data?",252
"Borg hall","TROI: That's not Data.",252
"Borg hall","PICARD: What?",252
"Borg hall","LORE: You should listen to her, Captain. She's way ahead of you.",252
"Borg hall","PICARD: Lore.",252
"Borg hall","LORE: Right. And I'm not alone.",252
"Borg hall","DATA: The sons of Soong have joined together. And together we will destroy the Federation. ",252
