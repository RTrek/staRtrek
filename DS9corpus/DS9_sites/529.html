DAX: Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: We're still venting plasma. Any ship within a hundred million
kilometres will know we're here and that we're not going anywhere. <br>
NOG: We have company, Captain. Two Dominion ships heading this way,
bearing one nine seven mark one three five. <br>
O'BRIEN: They'll have us in weapons range in twenty two seconds. <br>
DAX: Shields? <br>

DAX: On screen. <br>
WORF: Well done, Captain. You were a very effective decoy. <br>
DAX: How about next time we switch roles? That way I can rescue you. <br>
O'BRIEN: You may have to wait a while, Captain. We've just received
orders from Starfleet Command. All ships in this sector are to fall
back to Starbase three seven five. <br>
DAX: Fall back again. <br>
O'BRIEN: Engage, retreat, engage, retreat. I tell you, that's becoming
our favourite tune. <br>
BASHIR: Well, we'd better think of a new tune fast or the only song
we're going to be singing is Hail the Conquering Dominion. <br>
DAX: I wouldn't start learning those lyrics just yet, Doctor. Worf,

DAX: Benjamin, troop morale is at an all-time low. Even the Klingons

I'm sorry, Garak. <br>

well hidden. <br>
O'BRIEN: Ridiculous! <br>
GARAK: That's easy for you to say, Chief. You don't know them as well
as I do. These are desperate people. <br>
DAX: Garak, you're not going to get any of us to believe that Starfleet
Intelligence has implanted some kind of neural transponder in your
brain to monitor your thoughts. <br>
GARAK: I would have, if I were them. In fact, when I was conducting
interrogations for the Obsidian Order, I did a lot worse. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sure you did. <br>
WORF: They're not interrogating you, Mister Garak, they are debriefing.
There is a difference. <br>
GARAK: Not from where I'm sitting. <br>
DAX: Oh, I'll have a raktajino, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: And a raktajino. <br>
O'BRIEN: Look, Garak we are at war with the Dominion. Cardassia is part
of the Dominion. You are a Cardassian. And at one time, a fairly
important one. Of course Starfleet Intelligence is going to press you
for specifics. They need to know everything you know. <br>
WORF: Any small detail could prove extremely important. <br>
GARAK: Well, take it from me, it's a lot more fun asking questions than
answering them. All things considered, I'd rather be on the Defiant
with all of you. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, believe me, you haven't been missing much. <br>
DAX: Hopefully, all of that's about to change. <br>
BASHIR: You think Starfleet Command will approve Sisko's plan? <br>

SISKO: By putting together a task force comprised of elements from the
Second, Fifth and Ninth fleets, I believe that we can retake Deep Space
Nine, the most important piece of real estate in the quadrant. <br>
SITAK: (Vulcan lady Admiral) Your plan, Captain Sisko, is not without
merit. However, I remain sceptical. The Dominion will undoubtedly send
a large fleet to stop you. <br>
SISKO: And it will divert their forces and slow their advance into
Federation territory. <br>
ROSS: As well as leave their flank vulnerable. <br>
SISKO: Which will give us a chance to be on the offensive for a change.
<br>
COBURN: (human male Admiral) There's one thing that still concerns me. <br>
SISKO: What's that, Admiral? <br>
COBURN: Earth. You've left it a very tempting target. <br>
ROSS: Earth will still be defended by the Third Fleet. <br>
COBURN: But what if you're wrong, and the Dominion doesn't commit its
forces to protect Deep Space Nine? What if instead they launch a
full-scale assault on Earth? If we follow the plan you're proposing,
we'll never be able to get reinforcements there in time. <br>
SISKO: The Dominion won't attack Earth. <br>
SITAK: How can you be sure? <br>
SISKO: Because Earth isn't the key to the Alpha Quadrant. The wormhole
is. And whoever controls Deep Space Nine controls the wormhole.

QUARK: Unbelievable. Amazing. What nerve. Morn, you do have a problem,
but lucky for you the solution is simple. You're a grown man. If you
don't want to attend your mother's birthday party, you don't have to.
And if she keeps whining about it, just remind her there's a war on and

BAJORAN: I'm sorry, Major, but you're wasting your time. His orders
were quite clear. He doesn't want to see anyone. Not until his guest
has left. <br>
KIRA: And how long has his guest been visiting? <br>
BAJORAN: As far as I know, the female changeling has not left his
quarters for three days. <br>
JEM'HADAR: Step away from the door, Ferengi. <br>
KIRA: Hey! hey! <br>

ODO: Not all solids. Humans, Bajorans. <br>
FOUNDER: I really must thank you, Odo. <br>
ODO: For what? <br>
FOUNDER: For giving me new insight into the solids. <br>
ODO: And what have you learned? <br>
FOUNDER: That what they consider intimacy is only a shadow of what we
experience in the Great Link. You don't agree? <br>
ODO: I didn't say that. <br>
FOUNDER: You've done this before? <br>
ODO: Not often. <br>
FOUNDER: But when you have, you enjoyed it? <br>
ODO: Yes. <br>
FOUNDER: And you regret not having experienced it with Major Kira. <br>
ODO: I'd rather not discuss Major Kira. <br>
FOUNDER: I don't see why not. When we link, your feelings for her are
made very clear. <br>
ODO: Then why do you insist that we talk about it? <br>
FOUNDER: Because talking is still very important to you. But one day it
won't be. One day, the Link will be all you need. And that day is
coming soon. <br>
ODO: Is it? <br>
FOUNDER: It's amazing that you have survived this long without it. It's
only now, after I've been away from the Great Link myself, that I
understand how painful it must have been for you. <br>
ODO: It hasn't always been easy. <br>
FOUNDER: Odo, you never have to be alone again. <br>
ODO: Well, I'd better be going. There's a meeting of the station's
Ruling Council. Dukat and Weyoun are expecting me. <br>
FOUNDER: That meeting was held three days ago. <br>
ODO: Three days? Three days. How could I have lost track of that much
time? <br>
FOUNDER: Does that bother you? <br>
ODO: Yes, it does. <br>
FOUNDER: Well, don't let it. You've been living with the solids'
concept of time for too long. Let them worry about their meetings,
their schedules, their obligations. None of that has anything to do
with you. You are a changeling. You're timeless. As am I. <br>

WEYOUN: I know who the artist is. Her father gave it to me. He claims
it won some sort of prize on Cardassia. <br>
KIRA: Gul Dukat must be very proud. <br>
WEYOUN: I suppose. Is it any good? <br>

WEYOUN: I don't know how to judge it. You see, my people lack a sense
of aesthetics. <br>
KIRA: That's too bad. <br>
WEYOUN: I sometimes think so as well. But if aesthetics were truly
important, the Founders would have included it in our genetic makeup. <br>
KIRA: Or they made a mistake. <br>
WEYOUN: Gods don't make mistakes. Though sometimes I think it would be
nice to be able to carry a tune. So, what can I do for you, Major? <br>
KIRA: It's about Rom. <br>
WEYOUN: Oh yes, the Ferengi saboteur. <br>
KIRA: He has been in a holding cell for over a week. <br>
WEYOUN: Has it really been that long? <br>
KIRA: And I was hoping you would consider releasing him. <br>
WEYOUN: Impossible. You can't release a man and then execute him. It
makes no sense. <br>
KIRA: Execute Rom? <br>
WEYOUN: He committed an act of terrorism against the Dominion. Not only
did he try to interfere with our efforts to take down the minefield,
but, as I understand it, he was also the diabolical genius who came up
with the idea of self-replicating mines in the first place. I'm afraid
there's no getting around it, Major. He must be made an example so that
others think twice before they act against us. <br>
KIRA: He is married to a Bajoran citizen. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm well aware of that. And I'm willing to believe, for now,
his wife is not a co-conspirator. Otherwise, treaty or no treaty, she
would share her husband's fate. I'm sorry, Major. The Dominion takes a
dim view of terrorism. Your friend must pay the price for his crime. <br>
KIRA: We'll see what the Bajoran government has to say about that. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm afraid their pleas will fall on deaf ears. Major. Would
this be more aesthetically pleasing if it were blue?

taking down the minefield. You've got to finish what I started. The
fate of the entire Alpha Quadrant rests in your hands. Billions and
billions of people are counting on you. <br>

KIRA: How? <br>
JAKE: I'm a reporter. I have my ways. <br>
KIRA: Come on, Jake, this is no time for games. <br>
(Jake points at Morn, who is wrapping a present. Probably for his
mother.) <br>
KIRA: Morn? <br>
JAKE: He's going home for his mother's birthday or something. He has an
encrypted message for my Dad in one of her presents. <br>

Morn's present.) <br>
ROSS: Are you sure this is reliable? <br>
SISKO: I've known the courier for five years. I trust him. <br>
ROSS: Then we have a problem. According to this, the minefield's coming
down in three days. The Ninth Fleet won't be here for at least four. <br>
SISKO: Then I suggest we go without them. <br>
ROSS: What about the Klingons? <br>
SISKO: Looks like we go without them too. We've run out of time,
Admiral. <br>
ROSS: If those Dominion reinforcements come through the wormhole we'll
have lost everything. <br>
SISKO: We take the ships we have, fight our way to Deep Space Nine and
destroy that anti-graviton emitter. It's our only hope. <br>
ROSS: Do it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Looking out of the windows, a light blinks.) <br>
DUKAT: There. <br>
WEYOUN: Where? <br>
DUKAT: Over there. That flash of light was the anti-graviton beam
hitting a mine. <br>
WEYOUN: And disabling its replication unit. <br>
DUKAT: Exactly. Didn't you see it? <br>
WEYOUN: I'm afraid not. <br>
DUKAT: For months you've been demanding that I take down those mines
and now that it's finally happening, you can't even see it? <br>
WEYOUN: Weak eyes. <br>
DUKAT: Excuse me? <br>
WEYOUN: My people have poor eyesight. It's something we've learned to
live with. Jem'Hadar, on the other hand, excellent vision. I suppose
they need it more than we do. <br>
DUKAT: Ah, there's another one. <br>
WEYOUN: I'll have to take your word for it. <br>
DUKAT: Once we disable the replication units in all the mines, we can
detonate the entire minefield. And I guarantee you, weak eyes or not,
that explosion you will see. <br>
WEYOUN: When will you be ready to proceed? <br>
DUKAT: Approximately seventy eight hours. Three more days and we can
start to bring the Jem'Hadar reinforcements through the wormhole. <br>
WEYOUN: Excellent. I knew you could do it, Dukat. <br>
DUKAT: Did you? <br>
WEYOUN: I never doubted you for a moment. <br>
(Damar enters.) <br>
DAMAR: Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. <br>
DUKAT: Go ahead. <br>
DAMAR: The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while
the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border.
Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. <br>
DUKAT: Isn't that where Captain Sisko is stationed? <br>
DAMAR: He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. <br>
WEYOUN: Good for him. Now why have those fleets gathered there? <br>
DAMAR: I'm not sure. <br>
WEYOUN: You're not sure? Two large enemy fleets break off from the
front lines and rendezvous at a starbase and you have no idea why? <br>
DUKAT: Well, we'll have to find out, won't we? <br>
WEYOUN: See that you do. <br>
(Weyoun leaves.) <br>
DAMAR: He should speak to you with greater respect. <br>
DUKAT: Some day, I'll let you teach him that lesson. But right now,
there's something more pressing I need you to do. It's of a personal
nature, a matter of some delicacy. It's about my daughter. <br>
DAMAR: Ziyal? <br>
DUKAT: We've had a misunderstanding. I want you to go and convince her
to speak with me. <br>
DAMAR: Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy
fleet. <br>
DUKAT: I've given you an order, Damar. We're on the verge of a great
victory, and when it comes I want my daughter at my side. Is that
understood?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ZIYAL: I really believed my father had changed.
That he wanted to be a man of peace. <br>
KIRA: I think he believes that too, when it suits his purpose. <br>
ZIYAL: Everything he's ever said to me has been a lie <br>
KIRA: Not everything. He really does care about you. <br>
ZIYAL: I don't care. I am not going back to him. You don't believe me,
do you? <br>
KIRA: Right now you're angry and hurt, but that's going to pass. And
then you'll have to decide what to do. <br>
(Damar enters) <br>
DAMAR: Ziyal, I need to speak to you. <br>
ZIYAL: You and I have nothing to talk about. <br>
DAMAR: Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. <br>
ZIYAL: Well I don't want to see him. <br>
KIRA: You heard her. <br>
DAMAR: Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great
man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our
alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of
weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him
remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and
stand beside him. <br>
ZIYAL: It should be obvious, even to you, Damar, that I am not a true
daughter of Cardassia. <br>
DAMAR: What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to
rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and
it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. <br>
KIRA: Let her go. <br>
DAMAR: And if I don't, what happens then? <br>
KIRA: I was hoping you'd ask. <br>
(And she thumps him into oblivion) <br>
ZIYAL: Did you kill him? <br>
KIRA: No, but I thought about it. <br>
ZIYAL: What are you going to do when he wakes up?
KIRA: That's up to him.

<br>
ROSS: Your father sounds like a wise man. <br>
SISKO: And he makes a fierce jambalaya. <br>
ROSS: What's this? <br>
SISKO: Ancient Bajoran texts. <br>
ROSS: The Emissary looks for guidance on the eve of battle. <br>
SISKO: Guidance, insights, loopholes. I'll take anything I can get. <br>
ROSS: And what do the Prophets tell you? <br>
SISKO: That I have a long way to go before I can make any sense of
their prophecies. <br>
ROSS: Maybe when this war is over you can look at them closer. <br>
SISKO: That would be a change. Spend a week or two down on Bajor. Visit
the Dakeen Monastery. <br>
ROSS: I've never been on Bajor. I hear it's quite nice. <br>
SISKO: Nice? That hardly describes it at all. There are parts of the
Eastern Province that are like Eden itself. Lush green valleys covered
in wild flowers that seem to spring up overnight. Hundreds of small,
crystal clear ponds interconnected by waterfalls. <br>
ROSS: All right, all right, I'm convinced. I'm already planning my next
R and R down there. You know, it sounds like when your assignment on
Deep Space Nine is over and Bajor is welcomed into the Federation,
you're going to have a tough time saying goodbye. <br>
SISKO: I don't plan to say goodbye. I plan to build a house on Bajor. <br>
ROSS: And what if Starfleet assigns you to a different sector? <br>
SISKO: I will go wherever they send me, but when I go home, it will be
to Bajor.

FOUNDER: Neutralise Odo? Is that why you think I'm here? Odo is a

more to us than the Alpha Quadrant itself. Is that clear? <br>
