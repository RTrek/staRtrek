traffic pattern. <br>
DAX: Acknowledged. <br>
KIRA: Feel like getting together for dinner tonight? <br>
DAX: Can't. I'm having dinner with Captain Boday. <br>
KIRA: The Gallamite? You're going out on a date with him? <br>
DAX: Is something wrong with that? <br>
KIRA: No. Not at all. <br>
DAX: He happens to be brilliant. His brain is twice the size of yours

KIRA: I know. I've seen it. <br>
DAX: It's not his fault Gallamites have transparent skulls. <br>
KIRA: No, it's not. It's not exactly the view I want to have with
dinner. <br>
DAX: You know, Kira, sometimes I think you place too much emphasis on
how men look. <br>
KIRA: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
DAX: Nothing. <br>
KIRA: Look, when I kiss a man goodnight, I like to know where I'm
kissing him. <br>
DAX: I guess seven lifetimes gives me a somewhat broader perspective. <br>
KIRA: Since I have just one lifetime, I have to be a little more
particular about whom I go out with. <br>
DAX: I never said I wasn't particular. <br>
KIRA: I'm not the one who dates Ferengis. <br>
DAX: And what's that supposed to mean? <br>
KIRA: Nothing. <br>
DAX: Releasing docking clamps at upper pylon one. That's funny. I'm
picking up elevated. DS Nine to Bok'Nor. Shut down your engines!
Repeat, shut down your engines! <br>

DAX: Some kind of impulse overload. Checking. <br>

to be sure. <br>

official explanation. <br>
SISKO [on monitor]: Anything, Chief? <br>

ODO: All Bajoran outposts have been put on alert for retaliatory
strikes. The provisional government has made a statement disavowing any
responsibility. <br>
KIRA [on viewscreen]: Maybe it really was an accident. I mean, it is a
possibility. <br>
ODO: An accident involving a Cardassian ship in Bajoran space? If I
were a Cardassian, I wouldn't easily accept <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: That's odd. <br>
SISKO: What? <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: I'm picking up traces of a mercassium
compound. <br>
DAX: Mercassium? There shouldn't have been any mercassium on board that
ship. <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: Well, there was. <br>
SISKO: Meaning? <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: I'm not quite sure yet. <br>
ODO: Is mercassium some kind of explosive? <br>
SISKO: No, it's a synthetic composite used in shield generator
construction by the Federation. We don't share that technology with
anyone. <br>
DAX: Chief, I don't think you're going to find evidence of an explosive
device. <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: Lieutenant, respectfully, these kinds of
things take time and I've got to <br>
DAX: I don't think you're going to find an explosive device because I'm
pretty sure it was an implosive proto-matter device designed to match
the impulse signature. Just before the explosion, I picked up a sudden
increase in their fusion rate. I'm trying to find any sign of
malfunction in the Bok'Nor's engines to explain it but there just isn't
one. This doesn't look like an accident. The fusion shock had to be
caused by something external to the impulse drive system. <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: If a proto-matter device was attached to the
crossfeeds, that could have created the overload and we'd never see any
sign of it. <br>
SISKO: Can you prove that's what happened? <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: Maybe. If we could get a high resolution
spectra of the impulse debris. But that's going to take some <br>
SISKO: Time. Yes, I know. Get it started. I'll tell the Admirals. Sisko
out. <br>

HUDSON: Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: Cal. Thanks for coming on such short notice. <br>
HUDSON: I wish it didn't take a disaster like this to get us back
together. <br>
DAX: Hi, Calvin. <br>
SISKO: Jadzia Dax. <br>
HUDSON: Dax? My goodness. You look a lot better than the last time I
saw you. <br>
SISKO: Chief of Security Odo. Lieutenant Commander Calvin Hudson,
Starfleet's attachÃ©
to the Federation colonies in the new Demilitarised Zone. <br>
ODO: You must be concerned about the colonies' security at a time like
this. <br>
HUDSON: Well, we haven't noticed any unusual deployment from the
Cardassians along the border. <br>
ODO: Neither have we, and that's what's got me worried. <br>
SISKO: Let's go into my office. <br>
HUDSON: Lieutenant, I don't have time this trip, but you and I have a
few stories to catch up on. <br>

HUDSON: Yes, that would be extremely strange. So, Ben, how is Jake? <br>
SISKO: As tall as me. <br>
HUDSON: No. <br>
SISKO: He throws inside to knock the old man off the plate. <br>
HUDSON: A little chin music, huh? <br>
SISKO: He's growing up too fast. <br>
HUDSON: It must have been difficult for you. At least I didn't have a
child to raise by myself. <br>
SISKO: Well, we kind of helped each other through it. When I heard
about Gretchen, I wanted to be there for you. There was just no way to
get back. <br>
HUDSON: I know that, Ben. You know, I was hoping when they sent me to
the colonies that you and I would have time for some R and R together. <br>
SISKO: Who's got R and R time? <br>
HUDSON: I know. You can't imagine how my life has changed since the
Federation abandoned these colonies. <br>
SISKO: Abandoned them? Doesn't your presence there <br>
HUDSON: My presence there is a joke. I am supposed to help these
colonies function under the terms of the new treaty. Now Ben, what the
hell does that mean? <br>
SISKO: I thought these colonists wanted to stay. That they refused to
evacuate. <br>
HUDSON: The treaty gave away their territory to the Cardassians,
territory that these people had invested their lives in. Now, Ben, if
you knew them as I do, you'd know why they can't leave. It's a bad
treaty. The Federation gave away too much. <br>
SISKO: Several Cardassian colonies wanted to stay on the Federation
side of the Zone too. It seemed like a reasonable compromise <br>
HUDSON: Well, yes, the Cardassians would love to have their colonies in
our territory. Because they knew we'd protect them. But they have no
intention of doing the same for ours. <br>
SISKO: A number of Admirals at Starfleet Command are worried the
destruction of the Bok'Nor might jeopardise the treaty. <br>
HUDSON: Oh, are they really? <br>
SISKO: As the two ranking officers along the Cardassian border, we've
been asked to assess the potential risk. <br>
HUDSON: There is no risk, Ben. None. I have been dealing with the
Cardassians most of my professional life, and believe me, they are very
pleased with what they got from the treaty. They are not about to risk
all they've gained by sending forces into the Zone. They're much too
slick for that. If I were you, I'd be very concerned with security
along the Bajoran border. <br>
SISKO: Are you surprised they haven't responded at all yet? <br>
HUDSON: Well, Ben, you and I both know they never let you see what you
expect to see. They'll respond.

here this morning. I slipped in through the cargo bay. <br>
SISKO: And made your way here without anyone seeing you? <br>
DUKAT: I was the commander of this station for almost ten years. When
one knows the various corridors and passageways as well as I. Oh, by

true. I'm here unofficially to help you find out the truth about the
Bok'Nor. <br>
SISKO: Why would you want to help me? <br>
DUKAT: Because I already know the truth. <br>
SISKO: You know who's responsible? <br>
DUKAT: I do. <br>
SISKO: Who? <br>
DUKAT: You are. Oh, not you personally, Commander. I know you to be an
honourable man. You're not one to sneak around attaching implosion
devices to impulse engines. But, believe it or not, there are those of
your brethren who are willing to do such things. Morally superior human
beings and other members of the Federation. <br>
SISKO: I'm supposed to take your word for that? <br>
DUKAT: Of course not. It's my job to convince you so you can clean your
own house instead of forcing us to do it for you, which would certainly
endanger the new treaty. We'll need one of your runabouts. <br>

DUKAT: Commander, I'm not going to sit here and steal all your little
technical secrets, I promise you. <br>
SISKO: I appreciate your assurances, but Cardassians are famous for
their photographic memories. <br>
DUKAT: So you turn off my controls so I don't have enough light to take
my photograph, is that it? <br>
SISKO: I've heard they put Cardassian children in intense mind training
programmes when they're four years old. Is that true? <br>
DUKAT: The Cardassian educational system is unparalleled in the
quadrant. <br>
SISKO: If you don't mind taking the joy out of growing up. <br>
DUKAT: Education is power. Joy is vulnerability. <br>
SISKO: What? <br>

understand. Of all the humans I've met, you strike me as the most
joyless and the least vulnerable. <br>

you better on this journey. <br>

curious. It really doesn't matter. Cardassian pursuit vessels are years
ahead of this design. <br>
(A beep) <br>
DUKAT: What is it? <br>
SISKO: Long range sensors are picking up a distress signal. <br>
DUKAT: From whom? <br>
SISKO: A Federation merchant vessel under attack by Cardassians. I'm
reading two Cardassian attack vessels just inside the Demilitarised
zone. <br>
DUKAT: That's not possible. I promise you, Commander, we would not
violate the treaty. <br>
SISKO: The merchant vessel's comm. links are down. I can't raise them.
Computer, fix source coordinates of the distress signal and lay in a
new course, warp three. I hope you don't mind. <br>
DUKAT: Not at all. I'm as curious about this as you are. <br>
(The runabout goes to warp) <br>
DUKAT: What type of Cardassian ship are they? Patrol cruisers? <br>
SISKO: No, much smaller. They look like shuttlecraft. <br>
DUKAT: Cardassian shuttles attacking a Federation merchant ship? <br>
SISKO: They seem to be armed with Galor-class phaser banks. <br>
DUKAT: They must be from Cardassian colonies in the Demilitarised zone.
Hail them. <br>

Dukat, security identification ADL four zero. I order you to
immediately disengage your attack. <br>

are down to forty percent. <br>
DUKAT: Hail those Cardassians again. I don't know who you are or where
you come from, but you're going to pay for this, I promise you. Answer
me immediately or I personally will fire the photons that will destroy
you. Arm the photons. <br>
SISKO: The photon launcher is there. <br>
DUKAT: I know. I knew all about these controls before I ever came
aboard. Tell me when we're in torpedo range. <br>
SISKO: Stand by. I'm picking up another ship moving toward them. <br>
DUKAT: That's a Federation signature I believe, Commander. <br>
SISKO: It sure isn't from Starfleet. I've never seen a ship
configuration like that before. It almost seems like someone has
modified an old support courier. Hailing them. No response. They've
fired torpedoes. what kind of civilian vessel that size would be
carrying photon? <br>
DUKAT: Something from one of your colonies, perhaps? <br>
(The two Cardassian blips vanish from the monitor.) <br>

either one of us, they've managed to start their own little war out

starting with plomeek soup, which I know is a traditional Vulcan
favourite. Followed by jumbo Romulan molluscs. You can't get those back

QUARK: Certainly not. This is a special occasion. <br>
SAKONNA: It is? <br>

special occasion for any Ferengi. It's a cause for opening great
bottles of wine, dancing into the wee, small hours of the morning.
We'll let it breathe for a few minutes. <br>
SAKONNA: Very well, I will attempt to respect some of your cultural
idiosyncrasies. I will drink the wine, but I won't dance. <br>
QUARK: Maybe you'll change your mind after you drink the wine. <br>

QUARK: Rule of Acquisition number two fourteen. Never begin a business
negotiation on an empty stomach. <br>
SAKONNA: Rule of Acquisition? <br>
QUARK: Yes. Every Ferengi business transaction is governed by two
hundred and eighty five Rules of Acquisition to insure a fair and
honest deal for all parties concerned. Well, most of them anyway. <br>
SAKONNA: Commendable. To create a code of behaviour for business
transactions is <br>
QUARK: Is logical. <br>
SAKONNA: and quite reassuring. <br>
QUARK: Do Vulcans have anything similar? <br>
SAKONNA: In structure, it reminds one of the Vulcan Bill of Rights
which guarantees the fundamental personal freedoms of every Vulcan
citizen. <br>
QUARK: Same thing exactly. May I propose a toast? <br>
SAKONNA: Is this another cultural idiosyncrasy? <br>
QUARK: Yes. You know, I can't describe the honour I feel at this
moment. It's rare that a Ferengi and a Vulcan can overcome their
inherent differences to see eye-to-eye as we're doing. I've always had
the greatest respect for Vulcans, even though the few I've met haven't
exactly felt the same way about me. You are a noble people and I salute
you. Now then, what kind of business proposition do you have in mind? <br>

QUARK: I beg your pardon? <br>
SAKONNA: Guns, phaser banks, photon torpedoes <br>
QUARK: Shh! <br>
SAKONNA: (sotto) Troop transports and a number of cobalt-thorium
devices. My list is quite extensive. <br>
QUARK: You're a gun runner? <br>

KOBB: (woman) With an unprovoked attack. <br>
EVEK: Unprovoked, was it? Do you deny that the Federation is engaging
in organised terrorist activities against the Cardassian people?
Deliberately attempting to undermine this treaty? <br>
SISKO: The Federation does not conduct secret wars. <br>
EVEK: Then perhaps then you can explain where the Federation ship came
from, the one outfitted with photon torpedoes? <br>
HUDSON: Explaining why your ships were armed with Galor-class phaser
banks? <br>
EVEK: They have a right to defend themselves against organised
terrorist activities. <br>
SISKO: I haven't heard any proof yet of organised terrorist activities.
<br>
AMAROS: Because there is none. <br>
EVEK: On the contrary, we have the confession of the Federation
terrorist responsible for the destruction of the Bok'Nor at your
station, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Confession? <br>
(Evek's assistant hands him a PADD) <br>
EVEK: A forty three year old male human, William Patrick Samuels, born
Bergan, Norway, Earth. <br>
AMAROS: We know who he is. What have you done with him? <br>
EVEK: Came to the Federation colony on Volan Two twenty years ago.
Married, wife's name Louise, two female children aged fourteen and
twelve. He was quite cooperative once we apprehended him on Deep Space
Nine. <br>
(Hudson puts the data rod into a desk monitor) <br>
CARDASSIAN [OC]: Begin. <br>
SAMUELS [on monitor]: My name is William Samuels. I am being held for
crimes against the Cardassian people. I have been well treated. I have
confessed that, as a member of a well-armed anti-Cardassian force
organised by Federation colonists, I set an implosion device that
destroyed the freighter Bok'Nor. I deeply regret participating in this
arbitrary attack that led to the deaths of over seventy five crewmen.
To my wife and children, I'm sorry, and I love you. <br>
AMAROS: He would have confessed to anything after you were through with
him <br>
EVEK: On the contrary, he confessed quite early in the interrogation
procedure, far sooner than we expected. I believe he truly felt
remorse. <br>
HUDSON: We want to talk to him ourselves. <br>
EVEK: Bring him in. <br>
(A body is carried in on a stretcher) <br>
EVEK: Unfortunately, he committed suicide in his cell. <br>
(Amaros leaps over the table and tries to throttle Evek. Hudson pulls
him off) <br>
HUDSON: Come on, come on. It's all right, it's all right. <br>
SISKO: Dukat, get them out of here. <br>
DUKAT: Get outside. <br>
HUDSON: Go on. We'll talk later. <br>
KOBB: We can't let them get away with this. <br>
HUDSON: We'll talk later. You go on. Get him out of here. <br>
(A native american helps carry Samuel's body away again.) <br>
(Later.) <br>
HUDSON: I knew him. Bill Samuels was a farmer. He cultivated his land
for twenty years. He raised two kids on that land. He made something
out of that land and the Federation told him he had to give it all up
to the Cardassians. Well, he just was not willing to do that. <br>
SISKO: And it was people like him who made both sides realise that some
accommodation had to be made for the colonies so they could stay. <br>
HUDSON: The Cardassians have no intention of allowing these people to
stay. They will either force them out or they will kill them. It's
already started. Not a day goes when there's not some random act of
violence against our people. Every Federation colonist knows you do not
go out alone at night. Can you imagine living in that kind of fear? <br>
SISKO: If you're saying the Cardassian authorities are not enforcing
the laws, we can <br>
HUDSON: Enforcing the laws? The Cardassian authorities were part of a
mob that stoned two colonists on the streets of Ropal City three days
ago. <br>
SISKO: That's something the Federation can take up with the Cardassians
at the highest level. <br>
HUDSON: Well that will help a lot. The word is the Cardassian High
Command is arming their colonists to the teeth. <br>
SISKO: You really think they'd risk sending weapons into the
Demilitarised zone and breaking the treaty? <br>
HUDSON: I think they'll find a way to do it that's not so obvious. <br>
SISKO: Not long ago, we caught the Cardassians shipping weapons to
Bajoran extremists through a third party, the Yridians. <br>
HUDSON: That sounds about right. Could the Bok'Nor have been
transferring weapons to someone else to bring in here? <br>
SISKO: If it was, the transfer was made before the ship reached the
station. The cargo holds of the Bok'Nor were empty. Do you think he did
it? <br>
HUDSON: Samuels? I don't know. They could have forced him to make a
false confession and then killed him. <br>
SISKO: I don't think Gul Dukat would drag me all the way here unless he
knew he could prove it. <br>
HUDSON: Then, maybe he did do it, Ben. I don't know. Damn! I've got to
go see his wife. I don't know what I'm going to tell her. Makes you
pine for the good old dull days in New Berlin, doesn't it? Sausage and
beer all around, and everyone's idea of a good time was the mazurka
Festival. <br>
SISKO: Gretchen and Jennifer had a ball together there, didn't they? <br>
HUDSON: I'll never forget the sight of you in those lederhosen. <br>
SISKO: I still have the hat. Is there something larger going on here,
Cal? Are these colonists organising some kind of terrorist campaign? <br>
HUDSON: Well if they are, they're not about to tell me about it. But
I'll tell you one thing, Ben, between you and me, those people have
every right to defend themselves. When the Federation said goodbye to
them, they left them no other choice.

SISKO: You knew about Samuels before we left. <br>
DUKAT: I knew about his confession, yes. I didn't know he was. I was as
surprised as you were by his death. <br>
SISKO: No one is going to buy your suicide story. I don't care what he
did. This kind of barbaric disregard for life will gut this treaty. <br>
DUKAT: If it means anything, I entirely agree. I told Evek he was a
fool to let Samuels die. A good interrogator doesn't allow his subject
to die. You lose the advantage. <br>
SISKO: That's all you're interested in, isn't it. The advantage. <br>
DUKAT: Oh, now don't go spouting off your holier-than-thou Federation
fair-play dogma. And lest we forget, your man was responsible for the
deaths of seventy eight innocent crewman. <br>
SISKO: What was the Bok'Nor transporting? <br>
DUKAT: The Bok'Nor had just delivered fourteen metric tones of golside
ore to the Regulon system prior to its arrival at the wormhole. <br>
SISKO: You're sure it wasn't carrying weapons? <br>
DUKAT: Weapons? To whom? <br>
SISKO: To the Cardassians in the Demilitarised zone. <br>
DUKAT: No. The route of the Bok'Nor didn't take it anywhere near the
Demilitarised zone. <br>
SISKO: It could have rendezvoused with someone else. With the
Lissepians, maybe. They could have transferred the weapons to them and
they could have taken the weapons <br>
DUKAT: Commander, I know you'd love to find some justification for this
mass murder to ease your Federation conscience, but if the Bok'Nor was
carrying weapons, I would know. And on the lives of my children, I
swear to you it was not. <br>
SISKO: I didn't know you had children. <br>

up the Bok'Nor. There's no further threat of Cardassian reprisals to
Bajor. <br>
KIRA: I'll advise all of our outposts to stand down. Sir, are you, are
we facing the prospect of war here? <br>
SISKO: Not if I can help it. <br>
KIRA: But that's what the colonists are after. <br>
SISKO: I don't think they know what they're after, Major. I just know
they have to be stopped, and it's Starfleet's job to stop them. <br>
KIRA: Sir, I know this is none of my business <br>
SISKO: But you're going to give me your opinion anyway. <br>
KIRA: I don't know what the Cardassians told you <br>
SISKO: They played a confession from the man who planted the bomb. A
man they most likely tortured to death. <br>
KIRA: And you don't think you might be playing into their hands? <br>
SISKO: I've got people out there killing people, Major. You suggest I
turn a blind eye to that? <br>
KIRA: Well, they don't have a right to defend themselves? <br>
SISKO: They've crossed the line. <br>
KIRA: If Starfleet is unwilling to defend their people in <br>
SISKO: They chose to live with the Cardassians. <br>
KIRA: Well, I didn't. But I lived with them for twenty six years before
the liberation came. Every Bajoran lived with them in constant fear. I
know what those colonists are going through. Most of all, I know that
the Cardassians can't be trusted to keep their side of the bargain in
this treaty. <br>
SISKO: So, you'd suggest the Federation not keep our side of the
bargain either, perhaps by arming these colonists? <br>
KIRA: I can tell you one thing for certain. The Cardassians are the
enemy, not your own colonists, and if Starfleet can't understand that,
then the Federation is even more naive than I already think it is. <br>

argument with someone on his desk monitor behind the main dialogue.
Everyone is watching.) <br><i>SISKO: I'm hoping I don't have to remind the admiral how
many people pass through here during a week's time. It's not possible
to keep tabs on every single person while they're on the station <br>
ADMIRAL: If I didn't know you better, commander, I'd think you were
just making excuses <br>
SISKO: I'm not making excuses! Would it be in keeping with Federation
policy to frisk everyone who steps through our
airlocks? To search every room of every visitor during their stay? <br>
ADMIRAL: Of course not but with two kidnappings and a ship being
destroyed all in less than a week's time obviously your security
measures leave something to be desired <br>
SISKO: Security on this station is by the book. Our security programme
and the officers who work in it are first-rate. <br>
ADMIRAL: Then what were they doing when all this was happening? We here
at Starfleet are watching how you resolve
this situation very closely, commander. We think it might be prudent to
replace this chief of security you have <br>
SISKO: Odo is both highly intelligent and extremely thorough. He's the
most qualified person I have for the job. <br>
ADMIRAL: Still, it would be a concrete example that you are taking
active measures to resolve this situation and to
make sure it doesn't happen again. <br>
SISKO: I stand behind my chief of security one hundred percent. <br>
ADMIRAL: That may be a mistake, Commander <br>
SISKO: Then it's my mistake. <br>
ADMIRAL: Then let me make my point again. Starfleet is very unhappy
this has happened. We want this matter taken
care of immediately. I don't have to remind you how this reflects on
your position <br>
SISKO: We're doing everything we can to apprehend the kidnappers <br>
ADMIRAL: Don't bother me with details. Just clean up the mess,
Commander. And quickly. Before this becomes a permanent stain on your
record. Do I make myself clear? <br>
SISKO: Yes, sir. <br></i>BASHIR: What do you think they're telling him? <br>
KIRA: With two kidnappings and a ship exploding in the course of a
week, I'm sure they've got a few things to say. <br>
ODO: It's their own fault. I've been warning them from the beginning. <br>
O'BRIEN: What are you talking about, their fault? You're in charge of
Security. <br>
ODO: If you will let me be in charge of Security I will give you a safe
station. You people tell me to do my job then give me a Federation
rulebook listing all the things I can't do. Untie my hands before you
start to blame me, Mister O'Brien. <br>
DAX: I'm sure no one meant to blame you, Odo. <br>
ODO: Give me the right to set a curfew, let me do more searches of
arriving passengers, give me fifty more deputies. <br>
KIRA: And this station will be just the way it was during the
occupation. <br>
ODO: Say what you like, it was safer then. <br>
KIRA: Unless you happened to be a Bajoran. <br>
SISKO: I want a complete review of all security measures on board this

Vulcan female and a human male in a Starfleet officer's uniform. <br>
ODO: We're trying to locate anyone they might have contacted here. <br>
SISKO: How many ships left the station during the night? <br>
O'BRIEN: Only two, sir. A Bardeezan merchant ship and a Galador
freighter. <br>
SISKO: What were their destinations? <br>
O'BRIEN: The Bardeezans went through the wormhole. The freighter is
operating on a trade route between Galador Two and Farius Prime. <br>
SISKO: I'm guessing these people wouldn't take Dukat through the
wormhole. They'd head back to the Demilitarised Zone with him. Dax,
check the Galador ship's registry and make sure it's in order. Chief,
see if you can identify its warp signature from our sensor records. <br>
O'BRIEN: No problem, Commander. I've got it. <br>
SISKO: Last known course? <br>
O'BRIEN: The computer's showing it was on a bearing two one six, mark
one seven seven. As it left our sensor range, it was still heading for
Farius Prime. <br>
SISKO: Major, send a message to Farius Prime. If that ship shows up,
and I doubt it will, I want to know about it right away. <br>
KIRA: I could send the warp signature out over subspace. <br>
O'BRIEN: We could make it a general transmission. If it changes course,
someone should spot them. <br>
SISKO: Do it. <br>
DAX: It's a phony. The Galadorans don't have any ships in this sector.
The registry is forged. <br>
SISKO: Doctor, Major, you're with me. Odo, send a message to Commander
Hudson at the Volan colony that I'm moving in his direction on the
assumption that Dukat will be taken to the Demilitarised zone. Give him
the warp signature of the ship. <br>
ODO: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRA: Commander, we just received a general subspace transmission from
somewhere in the Demilitarised zone. A group there is taking credit for
the kidnapping of Dukat. They're calling themselves the Maquis.
