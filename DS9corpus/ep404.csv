"Replimat","BASHIR: You're very kind, Mister Garak.",404

"Ops","SISKO: To be honest, I haven't decided yet.",404
"Ops","GUL DANAR [on viewscreen]: He is Kohn-Ma! Even the Bajorans would not grant his kind asylum. He has committed heinous crimes against the Cardassian people and I demand you release him to our custody.",404

"Turbolift","KIRA: If I had been, I would not be working with the provisional government now.",404
"Turbolift","SISKO: You'd still be out murdering Cardassians or even some Bajorans that the Kohn-Ma hold in contempt. Didn't they claim responsibility for the assassination of one of your First Ministers last month? ",404
"Promenade","KIRA: Look, I know Tahna.",404
"Promenade","SISKO: Is he Kohn-Ma?",404
"Promenade","KIRA: Yes, but",404
"Promenade","SISKO: I suggest you get your priorities straight, Major, because I don't have any room for divided loyalties in this command. And I won't have a Kohn-Ma terrorist using this station as a protective shield for continuing violence.",404
"Promenade","KIRA: My priorities are straight, Commander. Let's not be confused here. my loyalties are to Bajor, and Bajor needs men like Tahna Los.",404
"Promenade","SISKO: Apparently his war with the Cardassians isn't over yet.",404
"Promenade","KIRA: If Bajor is ever to rebuild a strong and independent society, it will require the repatriation of splinter groups like the Kohn-Ma. You have, we have, an opportunity here, Commander. I hope you don't miss it. ",404

"Infirmary","KIRA: How is he?",404
"Infirmary","BASHIR: Second degree burns, lacerations, a minor concussion. Not much compared to what he's been through before.",404
"Infirmary","SISKO: Before?",404
"Infirmary","BASHIR: The most recent of these scars is only two, perhaps three years old.",404
"Infirmary","TAHNA: Two and a half, actually.",404
"Infirmary","BASHIR: It's remarkable you lived through this.",404
"Infirmary","KIRA: It's a Cardassian technique designed to keep you alive.",404

"Infirmary","KIRA: Commander Sisko hasn't decided whether to grant you asylum yet, Tahna.",404

"Infirmary","TAHNA: What do you need to know, Commander?",404
"Infirmary","SISKO: For starters, why were they chasing you?",404
"Infirmary","TAHNA: You really want to hear the story of my life?",404
"Infirmary","SISKO: I assume as a member of the Kohn-Ma you've committed serious acts against them.",404
"Infirmary","TAHNA: Any one of a hundred that would lead to a Cardassian death sentence.",404
"Infirmary","SISKO: Any of them since their withdrawal from Bajor?",404
"Infirmary","TAHNA: Frankly, yes.",404
"Infirmary","SISKO: Why would you continue the violence against them now?",404
"Infirmary","TAHNA: To be honest, I'm not sure anymore. We say we're punishing them for crimes committed against us for over half a century, but I've had enough of the killing.",404

"Ops","SISKO: No.",404

"Infirmary","(Tahna wakes with a start)",404
"Infirmary","KIRA: It's all right. You're safe.",404

"Infirmary","KIRA: Never.",404
"Infirmary","TAHNA: Working on the inside hasn't dulled that old fire just a little?",404

"Commander's Office","GUL DANAR: If you require all vessels to endure such lengthy docking procedures, Commander, you're going to have a lot of impatient traffic out there.",404
"Commander's Office","SISKO: I apologise. We're still trying to repair all the damage your forces did before they left. It does create unreasonable delays.",404
"Commander's Office","GUL DANAR: I accept your apology, but not your explanation. What about Tahna Los?",404
"Commander's Office","SISKO: Well, we've got a problem.",404
"Commander's Office","GUL DANAR: A diplomatic insult to the Cardassian people would be a problem. Delivering a wanted criminal to us would not be.",404
"Commander's Office","SISKO: Danar, in war, both sides commit atrocities.",404
"Commander's Office","GUL DANAR: I can only tell you that we are certain he plans to commit more acts of terrorism",404
"Commander's Office","SISKO: He tells me that he has renounced the Kohn-Ma and wants to help to rebuild Bajor.",404
"Commander's Office","GUL DANAR: He committed brutal acts of destruction and murder and he must pay for those crimes.",404
"Commander's Office","SISKO: I appreciate the Cardassian position but I know if a Bajoran freedom-fighter is turned over to the Cardassians by the Federation, that would be a mistake that would undermine everything that I'm trying to accomplish here. So, with apologies, I'm going to grant him asylum for the time being. Eventually, he'll want to relocate to Bajor and if you want to pursue the matter with the Provisional Government, then that's your business. ",404

"Tahna's quarters","TAHNA: I thought you were under Sisko's command.",404
"Tahna's quarters","KIRA: I am, but",404
"Tahna's quarters","TAHNA: You see, that's something I could never adapt to.",404
"Tahna's quarters","KIRA: Somebody has to coordinate relations between the Federation and the Provisional Government, At least with someone like me here",404
"Tahna's quarters","TAHNA: Why? Why should they be here at all? What right does this so-called Provisional Government have to bring them here",404
"Tahna's quarters","KIRA: I know",404
"Tahna's quarters","TAHNA: After everything we fought for, Kira. Freedom from domination, true independence. No outsiders. No Cardassians, and no Federations.",404
"Tahna's quarters","KIRA: Things have changed, Tahna. With the discovery of the wormhole",404
"Tahna's quarters","TAHNA: Oh, yes, the wormhole.",404
"Tahna's quarters","KIRA: Look, I don't want the Federation here any more than you do but they are serving a purpose. For the time being, at least. Without the Federation, the Cardassians would be back in a minute to take control of the wormhole. And the wormhole is the future of Bajor, Tahna. It's bringing ships and commerce. It's making us a power in the quadrant.",404
"Tahna's quarters","TAHNA: I don't want to be a power in the quadrant. I want Bajor for Bajorans. I want our homeland back.",404
"Tahna's quarters","KIRA: We have it back. And as we grow stronger, we'll be able to defend it ourselves without having to lean on the Federation or anyone else. I know it's difficult to see. After all we've been through, we want it all now. But with people like you leading the way",404

"Ops","KIRA: Sir?",404

"Ops","BASHIR: It's about Garak, the Cardassian? I'm afraid this relationship has gotten a little out of hand.",404
"Ops","SISKO: How's that?",404
"Ops","BASHIR: He wants me to buy a suit.",404
"Ops","SISKO: A suit?",404
"Ops","BASHIR: At exactly twenty fifty five tonight.",404
"Ops","SISKO: Why twenty fifty five?",404
"Ops","BASHIR: I don't know but it has something to do with those two Bajoran terrorists on board. He says that together, he and I might discover what they're really doing here. I don't understand why he wants me involved.",404
"Ops","SISKO: Sometimes communications can't be conducted through official channels. Maybe this is their way of telling us that we have a common enemy.",404
"Ops","BASHIR: Well, what do you want me to do?",404
"Ops","SISKO: I think, Doctor, you could definitely use a new suit. ",404

"Security office","ODO: You know, there's one thing about you humanoids I can't imitate very well.",404
"Security office","KIRA: What's that?",404
"Security office","ODO: Pretence. There's a special talent to it. It's as hard for me as creating one of your noses.",404
"Security office","KIRA: Maybe that's why I've learned to respect your opinion, Constable. Never any pretence. How much do you know about me, Odo?",404
"Security office","ODO: More than you probably realise.",404
"Security office","KIRA: I've done some things I'm not proud of. I still have nightmares about the raids on the Haru outposts, but at least I was sure of what I was doing then.",404
"Security office","ODO: And there's something you're not sure of now.",404
"Security office","KIRA: You have no more love for the Federation than I do.",404
"Security office","ODO: Meaning?",404
"Security office","KIRA: Maybe there are still wars to be fought and I'm just making a fool of myself doing what I'm doing here.",404
"Security office","ODO: It sounds like you're trying to talk yourself into something. Or out of something.",404
"Security office","KIRA: Either way, I have to betray someone.",404
"Security office","ODO: The only important thing is not to betray yourself.",404
"Security office","KIRA: How could I possibly turn against my own people?",404
"Security office","ODO: Are they? Your own people?",404
"Security office","KIRA: They're no different than I used to be.",404
"Security office","ODO: Used to be.",404
"Security office","KIRA: I could just refuse to help them. Ignore the whole thing.",404
"Security office","ODO: The Joranian ostrich hides by sticking its head under water. Sometimes even until it drowns.",404
"Security office","KIRA: Then they'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway and I'd still feel responsible for the consequences. It was so much easier when I knew who the enemy was.",404

"Garak's shop","GARAK: A rare crystalline element, that can be an incredibly powerful source of energy. Provided, of course, one also has an anti-matter converter. Unfortunately, that's why Cardassians were chasing Tahna Los when he arrived here. He stole one.",404
