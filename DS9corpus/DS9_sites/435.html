O'BRIEN: No, sir, it's fine. <br>
SISKO: You're sure? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm sure, Commander. Jake's a good fellow. I'll enjoy working
with him. <br>
SISKO: I don't want you to make it easy for him, Chief. He has to know
what it takes to make it in Starfleet. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll have him up to his elbows in thorium grease, sir. <br>
SISKO: It's not going to be easy for him. He placed in the lower third
of his age group in mechanical aptitude. <br>
O'BRIEN: Good for him. So did I. <br>
SISKO: You? Come on. <br>
O'BRIEN: No, it's true. It wasn't till I got to the Cardassian front I
found I had talents I never knew I had. <br>
SISKO: At the front? <br>
O'BRIEN: It was a matter of figuring out how to get a field transporter
operational in ten minutes or wind up a Cardassian prisoner of war.
Now, I didn't know a transporter from a turbolift in those days but
somehow, in nine minutes fifty three seconds, I got that thing to work.
I got thirteen men safely off the surface of Setlik Three. Next thing I
know I'm the tactical officer on the Rutledge. That's how I got the
gold suit. <br>
SISKO: Well, Jake's ready for a new suit too. The boy seems to grow a
centimetre each week. You know, he struck me out with a curve ball the
other day. First time. <br>
O'BRIEN: They grow up in a hurry, don't they, sir. <br>
SISKO: That they do. <br>
O'BRIEN: I think I've got one. Computer, set a new heading, four one
mark three zero one. <br>
COMPUTER: Confirmed. <br>
SISKO: It's an M class all right. One hundred and sixty million
kilometres from Orellius Minor. Should be a perfect place to set up a
colony. <br>
O'BRIEN: Only it looks like someone's beat us to it. <br>
SISKO: You're reading life forms? <br>
O'BRIEN: Human life forms. <br>
SISKO: I don't see anything on the books about a colony in the Orellius
system. <br>
O'BRIEN: Trying all hailing frequencies. <br>
SISKO: Moving into synchronous orbit. <br>
O'BRIEN: No response. I'm picking up some kind of low level duonetic
field down there. It may be blocking communications. <br>
SISKO: Let's introduce ourselves to our neighbours. </font></p>

O'BRIEN: Even the self-diagnostics aren't working. It's plain dead. <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Rio Grande. Computer, respond. <br>
O'BRIEN: (trying his phaser) I'd say there's no EM activity at all
around here. <br>
SISKO: Any idea why? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not sure, but it might have something to do with that
duonetic field our sensors picked up. <br>
SISKO: Well, I hope you find a few more of those talents you never knew
you had, because if you don't we're going to have a hard time getting
off this <br>
VINOD: Don't move! <br>
(A man is aiming an arrow at their backs, using a longbow. That's
deadly.) <br>
VINOD: And put your hands up. <br>
(After the opening titles) <br>
VINOD: Turn around. Slowly. <br>
JOSEPH: (older, stouter) They're from Starfleet. <br>
SISKO: That's right. Mind if we put our hands down? <br>
(Joseph gets Vinod to rest the bow) <br>
JOSEPH: The uniforms have changed, or have I just forgotten what they
looked like? My name is Joseph. Vinod's the one playing with the sharp
object. <br>
SISKO: Benjamin Sisko, and this is Miles O'Brien. <br>
VINOD: How did you get here? <br>
O'BRIEN: We were going to ask you the same thing. <br>
SISKO: We were surveying for habitable planets when our sensors picked
up your lifesigns. There was no record of a human colony here. <br>
JOSEPH: Our group was on its way to settle on Gemulon Five over ten
years ago when our ship developed life support problems, and we had to
land here for repairs. <br>
VINOD: Once we got here, all our systems failed. Nothing worked
anymore. <br>
O'BRIEN: So we've seen. <br>
JOSEPH: We've been stuck here ever since, and I guess you are too now. <br>
SISKO: We have a ship in orbit. It won't take our people long to find
us. <br>
O'BRIEN: We'll be able to get all of you out of here. <br>
JOSEPH: After ten years, this is our home. <br>
O'BRIEN: But you just said it yourself. Nothing works. <br>
JOSEPH: Well, we still do. Come, we'll show you. Vinod, run ahead and
tell your mother we have guests. Come.

SISKO: Erewon-class personnel transport. <br>
JOSEPH: Commissioned the Santa Maria. Now, we just call it the Cabin. <br>
ALIXUS: (a red-headed woman) After all this time, visitors! <br>
JOSEPH: Alixus, meet Ben and Miles. <br>
ALIXUS: Welcome to our community. Miles. Are there others? <br>
SISKO: Just an empty runabout in orbit. Hopefully, it'll attract some
attention. <br>
JOSEPH: A runabout. Is that some kind of new Starfleet vessel? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah, they commissioned the first ones two years ago. They're
a short-range interstellar craft about a quarter the size of your cabin
here. <br>
JOSEPH: I was the engineer aboard the Santa Maria. <br>
ALIXUS: You and Miles will have a lot to talk about, Joseph. I'm sure
all of us have questions for our guests. <br>
VINOD: Who won the soccer matches this year? Is Golanga still playing? <br>
SISKO: No, he hurt his knee four years ago. They replaced it with a
bio-implant but he wasn't the same after that. Who was it that won last
year anyway? I never can remember. <br>
CASSANDRA: What are women's fashions like back home now? <br>
SISKO: Chief, you're the married one. <br>
O'BRIEN: Keiko, my wife, she's been replicating longer dresses lately. <br>
CASSANDRA: (deadpan) Oh, no. That means I'll have to alter everything I
own. <br>
(Laughter) <br>
O'BRIEN: That might just be the Bajoran styles she sees on Deep Space
Nine. <br>
JOSEPH: On Deep Space Nine? <br>
ALIXUS: I'm sure Ben and Miles will be happy to tell us everything we
want to know. There'll be plenty of time for that later. <br>
O'BRIEN: Actually, the first thing I'd like to do is to try and get
some response from the EM systems. <br>
ALIXUS: We gave up any hope of that years ago. <br>
SISKO: Yes, we noticed a low-level duonetic field in the area before we
transported down. <br>
ALIXUS: Yes, the same thing appeared on our sensors when we were
landing. Our engines failed almost the instant we hit the surface. <br>
JOSEPH: Without a functional tricorder, it was virtually impossible to
track down the source. <br>
ALIXUS: We do know that the marshes all around us are filled with
astatine deposits. That's the only explanation we have. But we've done
pretty well without our tricorders and EM converters and comm. links
haven't we? After all, the human body is a powerful tool. We can plow
the crops, harvest the fields, construct the walls that we need for
protection against the wilderness, weave clothes that we need to stay
warm. In a way, we've rediscovered what man is capable of without
technology. It hasn't been easy. We've had some bitter winters and
we've lost some dear friends. But we're very proud of what we've
accomplished here. <br>
SISKO: You have every right to be. <br>
CASSANDRA: Are we all going to leave when the others come to rescue
them? <br>
ALIXUS: That's something each of us is going to have to think about,
isn't it. <br>
CASSANDRA: Are you going to leave, Alixus? <br>
ALIXUS: Speaking for myself, no. No, I'll never leave. And I'll never
want what we have in our community to change. It means too much to me.
But while you are here, you are welcome to everything our community has
to offer. The only thing we ask is that you contribute. We all work for
our supper. You'd be surprised how much sweeter it tastes when you do. <br>
SISKO: We'll be happy to do our part. <br>
ALIXUS: Joseph, would you find them some bunks, please? <br>
(Joseph leads Sisko and O'Brien away, and Alixus goes to Vinod) <br>
ALIXUS: Two more strong, healthy men, Vinod. That could mean an awful
lot to this community.

DAX: Best poker player in the fleet, next to me. <br>
KIRA: Well, he's diverting the Crockett to stop at DS Nine day after
tomorrow to talk about Cardassian foreign policy? <br>
DAX: That's just an excuse to get Benjamin in a game. Mitsuya cleaned
him out last year. We'd better hail the Rio Grande and get them back
this way. I've worked two lifetimes on Benjamin's poker. He just can't
learn how to bluff. <br>

O'BRIEN: Commander. <br>
SISKO: Come in, Chief. I'm just reading one of the books our host has
written. Alixus is quite a prolific author. <br>
O'BRIEN: A bunch of these were left in my room too. I haven't had a
chance to look at them. What does she write about? <br>
SISKO: She seems to have something to say on just about everything. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah? <br>
SISKO: Economic analysis, political commentaries, literary critiques.
She says she's spent her life examining the human condition. <br>
O'BRIEN: What's her prognosis? <br>
SISKO: Not very good. She says we've become fat and lazy and dull. <br>
O'BRIEN: My wife told me something along those lines just last week. <br>
SISKO: (reading) The common conceit that the human species has evolved
over the last several centuries is ludicrous. What gains we have made
have come at the cost of our own core identities. Man has lost touch
with his true power. <br>

paradise.

You name it, it's gone. The ship looks like it's been through a Ferengi
junkyard. <br>
SISKO: What happened to it all? <br>
JOSEPH: We threw it away. Well, since none of it worked, to us it was
merely useless junk taking up space. <br>
SISKO: Alixus felt its presence was a constant reminder of who you used
to be. <br>
JOSEPH: Well, we all had to abandon our dependence on technology.
Removing every trace of it, well, that made the transition easier. <br>
O'BRIEN: As an engineer, you must've had some problems with that. <br>
JOSEPH: I was the last convert. But as time passed, I realised Alixus
was right. She was helping us discover a new philosophy of life
together, because we needed one to survive. And I'll tell you, every
one of us is better for it. We're more committed to each other. We are
truly a part of each other's lives. We've renewed a sense of community
that man left behind centuries ago. <br>

found a cure for. We've lost three to it already. <br>
SISKO: Have you found anything in the forest like the sleeger fungi? <br>
JOSEPH: We've searched everywhere for the right fungus or root that
would draw out the infection. <br>
SISKO: If it keeps spreading, she'll die before the rescue team finds
us. <br>
O'BRIEN: The medical kit in the runabout could probably take care of
this in a second. <br>
SISKO: We've got to find a way to restore the comm. link to the
transporter. <br>
ALIXUS: It would only be a waste of time. <br>
O'BRIEN: This duonetic field inhibits energy flow, but a duonetic field
is a form of energy too. Maybe we could modify our communicators to run
on the field itself. <br>
JOSEPH: Do you really think you could? <br>
ALIXUS: No. If you want to put your efforts to good use, search the

ten years, we wouldn't have been doing what was necessary to survive
here. To find the plants, herbs, molds that cure disease. We've
conquered seventeen illnesses with the most powerful resource man has.

exactly and I'll transport over. <br>
DAX: Like hell you will. <br>
KIRA: Sorry, I'm the ranking officer here. <br>
DAX: At warp, I wouldn't be in such a hurry to volunteer. <br>
KIRA: You got a better idea? <br>
DAX: I'm the science officer. It's my job to have a better idea. <br>
KIRA: What are you doing? <br>
DAX: Trying an old rope trick I learned on Earth once. <br>
KIRA: A rope trick. <br>
DAX: A very talented Hopi I knew did things with a rope you wouldn't
believe. It's an old West American artform. <br>
KIRA: You're suggesting we try to rope the Rio Grande at warp? <br>
DAX: With a tractor beam. <br>
KIRA: Once we pull it back to impulse, isn't there a risk that the
strain will rip both hulls apart? <br>
DAX: If the ship assembly teams back in the yards did their jobs really
well, we'll probably make it. If they had an off day, we're going to
have a problem. But it's our best shot. Unless, a as ranking officer,
you have a better idea. <br>
KIRA: We're within tractor range. Locking on. <br>
(The third try grabs the runabout) <br>
DAX: Engaging impulse engines. <br>
(Everything shakes and rattles until they drop out of warp) <br>
DAX: Remind me to send a thank you note to the assembly teams. <br>
KIRA: All stop. Computer, ready transporter.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The people are summoned for an announcement.) <br>
ALIXUS: Meg has died. Suddenly, quietly. No one was prouder of what
we've accomplished here than Meg was. Her dedication to this community
and to us was an inspiration, which is why I find myself so troubled
today by an act that by its very nature defiles her memory. Vinod? <br>
(Vinod brings O'Brien out) <br>
ALIXUS: All of us have welcomed our new arrivals with open arms, but
they continue to reject us. Despite their agreement to respect our
fundamental way of life, this man has committed the worst offense that
can be committed against this community. He has selfishly wasted
precious time that could have been put to productive use. Miles was
discovered trying to activate his technological devices so he could
return to his ship. <br>
JOSEPH: Alixus, I'm sure he only wanted to get to the medical equipment
that might have saved Meg's life. <br>
ALIXUS: Thank you, Joseph. I knew you would feel that way and I'm glad
you said it, so that all of us could see the true danger these two
represent. Our very own Joseph defending what he knows is wrong. He
knows that if we had spent our energy all these years trying to escape,
we'd all be dead today. This is good. This is a test of our
convictions, and we will survive. <br>
(The metal box is opened up) <br>
SISKO: You're not going to put him in there. <br>
ALIXUS: No, Ben, I'm not. You are his commanding officer. I hold you
responsible for his actions. I'm putting you in there. <br>
O'BRIEN: Wait a minute! <br>
(O'Brien is restrained, and a pointed stick held against him. Sisko
gives Vinod his hand-hoe and gets into the little oven, to bake in the
sun)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Runabout Rio Grande]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: No signs of resistance. None of the onboard
weapons has been fired. <br>
DAX: But the logs have been erased. Someone else must have been here. <br>
KIRA: Maybe Sisko and O'Brien beamed off before the ship was boarded.
But why would somebody send the runabout off at warp? Why wouldn't they
just keep it or destroy it? <br>
DAX: I think they were trying to destroy it. <br>
KIRA: How can you tell? <br>
DAX: The hull's been exposed to high temperatures and intense gamma
radiation. If we retrace the Rio Grande's course it takes us right back
to <br>
KIRA: An F-type star. <br>
DAX: Orellius Minor. There's only one way this ship could be coming
straight from Orellius Minor and that's if someone tried to destroy the
ship by flying it into the star. <br>
KIRA: And missed. <br>
DAX: If the trajectory had been slightly off, the star's gravity flux
would have deflected it in a new direction. Computer, send a tractor
beam to the Orinoco. Prepare for a warp tow. With a little luck, we'll
be able to find the warp signature the engines left when they were
fired up. <br>
COMPUTER: Tractor beam in place. <br>
KIRA: Course laid in for the Orellius system. Engaging warp engines.

ALIXUS: Please. (he sits) This is painful for me, too. I want so much
to give you water, to let you lie down to sleep. But I can't. Not
without your help. I know it's too difficult to speak right now. Just
rest. Change doesn't come easily to you, Ben. I realise it. Believe me,
I'm not expecting some sudden, miraculous conversion. Change will come
by itself if you're open to it. But you do have to show us that you're
open to it. A good start would be to get rid of the uniform. I'll leave
you these clothes. Once you've changed, you can have this water. Join
us, Ben. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(O'Brien is banging the rocks together, and making
sparks.) <br>
JOSEPH: Miles? What are you doing here? <br>
O'BRIEN: I need your help, Joseph. <br>
JOSEPH: With what? There's nothing I can do, so please don't ask me. <br>
O'BRIEN: I've got to try to track down where that duonetic field is
coming from. <br>
JOSEPH: We told you there are astetine deposits. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's not what's causing it. If it were, I'd have that
transmitter running and we'd all be out of here already. It's got to be
something else and I think I've figured a way to get me to the source
of it. <br>
JOSEPH: And you want me to look the other way while you leave? <br>
O'BRIEN: She'd put you in the box, wouldn't she. Then, do me a favour.
Look down at that hematite deposit I just discovered. <br>
JOSEPH: Miles <br>
O'BRIEN: I can do it so it won't hurt at all. <br>
(Joseph kneels down and O'Brien knocks him out.) <br>
O'BRIEN: I owe you one, my friend. <br>
(O'Brien picks up a gourd and some rock and leaves)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(O'Brien has made a compass with the magnetite rock
and a gourd of water. When his 'needle' starts spinning, he scrapes
away the leaf litter to find a box with flashing lights. As he is
kneeling, an arrow thuds into the tree behind him. It's Vinod. O'Brien
runs. Vinod sees the gold of the uniform shoulder and shoots it, but
O'Brien's not wearing it. He pounces on Vinod, knocks him out and
unstrings the bow.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, you finally got one of us out of our uniform.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Compound]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: Come on, move it. Where's Alixus? <br>
(O'Brien has tied Vinod's hands with his own bow string) <br>
O'BRIEN: Get her out here! <br>
(O'Brien phasers open the metal box and helps Sisko out.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Get him some water! (Stephan does) Do you know why this phaser
is working now? Because I shut down the duonetic field that was
stopping it from working. An artificially created duonetic field. <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Rio Grande. Computer, respond. <br>
ALIXUS: Your ship is no longer in orbit, Ben. I destroyed it. <br>
(Alixus unties Vinod) <br>
SISKO: I assume that means you control the duonetic field. <br>
ALIXUS: I helped invent it. You'd be surprised how many scientists are
sympathetic to my philosophies. <br>
JOSEPH: Then it was no accident we developed life support problems near
this planet. <br>
ALIXUS: No. We were always on our way here, Joseph. I chose it months
in advance. It was far away from any trade route, completely isolated.
It was perfect for our ideal community. I hoped when we landed we would
never leave here. <br>
CASSANDRA: You lied to us. You've been lying to us for ten years. <br>
ALIXUS: Yes, but perhaps a lie can lead to a more important truth.
Would any of you have learned who you really are at the core if you
hadn't have come here? Joseph, you would have been a repairman all of
your life. Cassandra, you would have been a technical clerk in some
closed-in room. And Stephan, my friend, you probably would have been in
prison by now. Look at yourselves. Look at what you've become. What
you've achieved here has redefined your potential, the potential of
man. Just as I knew it would. You are the living proof. <br>
SISKO: What of the dead? What of Meg and the others? <br>
ALIXUS: Only my son knows how I have suffered as I watched each of them
die. <br>
SISKO: You were willing to let them die for your theories. You're going
to have to answer for what you've done. <br>
ALIXUS: I'm prepared to go with you. Casualties were inevitable. I had
to accept that from the start. <br>
SISKO: What if it were your son who had been sick? Would you let him
die, too? <br>
ALIXUS: Yes. For the sake of the community. I did it all for the
community. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Kira to Sisko. Are you all right, Commander? <br>
SISKO: Everything is under control, Major. Stand by to begin multiple
transports. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
O'BRIEN: We have room for all of you on the runabout. If you have
anything you want to bring with you, you ought to get it now. <br>
JOSEPH: Miles, this is our home. Whatever Alixus may be guilty of, she
did give us our community. I'm not sure if we'll leave the device on or
off now that we know it's there. And we'll have to decide if we want to
establish contact with the outside world. But Alixus is right. We have
found something here that none of us is willing to give up. <br>
ALIXUS: It's time for those of us who don't belong here to leave, Ben. <br>
SISKO: Four to beam up, Major. <br>
(Sisko. O'Brien, Alixus and Vinod are beamed away.) <br>
JOSEPH: Come. Come. </font> </p>
